# ATM Interface
Developed a fully functional ATM simulation program in Java, incorporating key features such as user authentication, transaction management (withdrawals, deposits, and transfers), and transaction history tracking. Ensured a robust user experience through clear input validation and error handling. Utilized object-oriented principles to design and implement the application, resulting in a modular, maintainable, and efficient codebase.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented user authentication mechanisms.
Developed features for managing and recording financial transactions.
Ensured code modularity with classes for transactions and transaction history.
Applied error handling for a smooth user experience.
